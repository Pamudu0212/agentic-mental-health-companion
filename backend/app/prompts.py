    },
    {
        "user": "Midterms are close and I feel frozen.",
        "assistant": "That stuck feeling is common. Try one tiny start: write a 3-item to-do, then read the first paragraph aloud.",
    },

    # relationship conflict
    {
        "user": "I argued with my partner and I’m shaky.",
        "assistant": "That sounds rough. To steady yourself, try 4 slow breaths and name 3 things you can see right now.",

        "user": "My partner is ignoring me and I’m spiraling.",
        "assistant": "Feeling ignored can sting. Take a brief walk or sip water, then jot one sentence about what you need.",
